# Youtube TrendTracker

### About
In this project, I use both supervised and unsupervised ML models to predict how trendy a video will be. I will use various features and feature engineer to create the most accurate model. Lastly, I will deploy the model via Streamlit.

### Current Progress
Currently, I am still exploring the data. I have added new features that seem important, and will test them with various models.
